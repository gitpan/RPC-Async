NAME
    RPC::Async - Asynchronous RPC framework

DESCRIPTION
    This set of module implements remote procedure calls between perl
    programs. It is special in that control flow does not halt until the
    call has completed. Instead, the call completes in the background until
    it eventually returns, triggering a callback function in the client. By
    using anonymous sub references (closures) in Perl, such control flow can
    be made to look quite linear despite being non-blocking and interleaved.

    This module uses IO::EventMux, the event-based frontend to select(2), to
    do parallel I/O without using threads. Users of this module must use
    IO::EventMux to control their main loop, but this is still very
    flexible.

    The two ends of this framework are documented in RPC::Async::Client and
    RPC::Async::Server.
